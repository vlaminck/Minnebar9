runIn(seconds, method) // one time
schedule(Date, method) // one time
schedule(timestamp, method) // one time
schedule(timeString, method) // daily at time
schedule(cron, method) // follow schedule

runOnce(Date, method)
runHourly(Date, method)
runDaily(Date, method)


1 minute is the finest grain we really support.
We will try runIn(6, method), but anything less than a minute is not guaranteed.
